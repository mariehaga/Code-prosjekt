            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>
              In 2016, we founded Grossist AS to make it easier for smaller companies to order healthy, freshly made lunches. We had noticed from our own work enviroment that it was way too easy to go for the unhealthy burger or chocolate-bar when lunchtime came around. <br><br> In a work-enviroment with no kitchen, and no nearby healthy fast-food shops, one would rely on bringing homemade lunches to eat a proper meal. We know that not everyone has the time or energy to prepare homemade meals to bring to work, but that shouldn't stop you from having the most important meal of the day.<br><br>

              By ordering lunches for your employees from us, you ensure that your staff is staying healthy and focused during work-hours. Please, don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you have any questions!
